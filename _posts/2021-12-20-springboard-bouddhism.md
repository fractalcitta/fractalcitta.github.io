Talking with Beau, I realised that I've worked on a similar project many years ago. 
His idea is to create a sort of "platfrom" to bring the Buddha's teaching to a wider public and make it very accesible and practicle.
Allowing people to get familliar with the Dhamma in a non traditionally focus way.

### A New Branch ?

Create a course for begginers. There is the Suttavada that is starting to emerge as a new branch now. See [Suttavada Fundation](https://www.suttavada.foundation/)

### Logo

Using a mandala Symbol. I've design the "Magga Stupa" which can be used.

### Theravada Video Project (TVP)

Creating next generation video material, similar to Veritasium. Like this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgF3OX8nT0w).

Another good inspiration is [Ajahn Sona Youtube Chanel](https://www.youtube.com/c/AjahnSona).

### Sangha App

An old project I had with a programmer. Creating an App that allow meditators (or Dhamma enthousiastic) to find each other in the real workd.

Below is an old draft of a similar project in a Vipassana Center.
